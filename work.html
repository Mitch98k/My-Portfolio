            <p>You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Put it in, leave it alone. It's important to me that you're happy. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.</p>
            <p>Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.</p>
            <p>You have to make these big decisions. We'll play with clouds today. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</p>
            <p>Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>
            <p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.</p>
            <p>Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>
            <p>I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Here's another little happy bush If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>
